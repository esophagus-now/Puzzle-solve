REASSEMBLY
----------
Take care to orient all the loose pieces according to 
their original positions. A is the one with only one 
dark square on top, D is the one with three dark squares
on top, and both B and C have two dark squares, but B is 
the one with the notch that A fits into.

Place C so that it is in the NW corner and its chin pokes over the north side
Place A so that it is in the NE corner and its chin pokes over the east side
D can now be placed so that it goes all the way to the bottom
D west
A south (chin should poke over the south side)
Place B right in the middle. It won't go to the bottom.
D up
B west, it should fit into the gap between C and D
A north
D east 
B east
C south. Don't let it fall.
B west. Now B, C, D all fall naturally.
B west, then north
C up 
D west
D north, should nicely fit over A and B
C east, should poke chin over the edge
B south, should poke chin over the edge
D west, then south 
A all the way west
C north
D east, then north. Should fit over A and C 
B east 
D west, then south, then west. A falls naturally.
D up
A south 
C west (doesn't go all the way)
B north, then falls naturally, then all the way north
D east. Falls naturally by a "half square"
A south 
C west 
B, D up
A east, then north, then east into the gap in B and D
C south. Don't let it fall.
